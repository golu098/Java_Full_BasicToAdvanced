TreeMap usage when :-

It is crucial to save memory.
You don't know the number of elements to be stored in memory.
You want to retrieve elements in natural order.
You know that objects will be added and removed repeatedly.
The O(log(n)) is acceptable for you.

The compareTo() method is used to define the natural order of objects
 The comparison ordering starts with the most significant fields.
  If the comparison of these fields yields a value other than zero (zero means equality), you simply get the result.
   If the most significant fields are equal, you compare the subsequent ones.
    The field comparison is performed until two unequal fields are found or until all fields are equal.


    interface implemented in TreeSet<E> will allow for natural element ordering:- java.lang.Comparable

    methods does the Comparable<T> interface define:- compareTo(Ascending order)


-----------Questions---------


-- why Pq will be printed first then not sorted ?
-- if 2 key stored same value in hashtable then ?
--- hashtable code:- random order



--- ArrayDeque vs Deque
